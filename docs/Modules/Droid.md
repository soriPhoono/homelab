# Droid Modules

Droid modules provide a bridged experience for Android devices running Nix-on-Droid.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Nix Configuration**: Optimized nix settings for mobile hardware.
- **User Management**: Standardized user and group settings for the Termux-based environment.
- **Activation Packages**: Home Manager is integrated into the rotation, allowing mobile devices to share many of the core Home modules (like git and shell configs) with the desktop systems.

## 🧩 Usage

Droid configurations are stored in the `droids/` directory and leverage the `mkDroid` builder.
