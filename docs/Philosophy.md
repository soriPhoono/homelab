# Philosophy

## The Data Fortress

The **Data Fortress** is not just a homelab; it is a self-sovereign infrastructure designed for resilience, privacy, and control. It integrates everything from edge devices to powerful virtualization clusters into a cohesive whole.

## Single Command Invocation

We adhere strictly to **Single Command Invocation**.

- **No Scripts**: If it requires a manual bash script, the flake is broken.
- **Declarative**: Everything is defined in Nix.
- **Stable**: `nix flake check` is the absolute truth.

## Issue-First Development

Every change starts with a **GitHub Issue**. Code follows intent, not the other way around.
