# Homes Overview

Home configurations manage the user-level environment, including shells, applications, and specialized developer tools.

## 👤 Primary Profiles

- [soriphoono](./soriphoono.md): Neovim-centric developer profile with AI integration.
- **spookyskelly**: KDE-focused desktop profile.

## 🪐 Specialization

Our architecture allows for **Home Specialization** across different systems. This means a user profile can be tailored for:

- **Laptops**: Full desktop apps and GUI tools.
- **Droids**: CLI-focused mobile environments.
- **Servers**: Minimal, remote-access oriented setups.

Configurations are stored in `homes/` and associated with systems via the `users` option.
